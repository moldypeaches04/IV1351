This project was done in a group of three, I worked with Linnea Údén and William Sjöberg who are fellow students at KTH.
The goal of the project was to create a database that handles data as well as applications that handle operations.
This repository includes a Contemporary Model, a Logical model as well as basic queries in SQL. Please have a look around and if you have any questions please contact me!
