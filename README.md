This project was done in a group of three, I worked with Linnéa Udén and William Sjöberg who are fellow students at KTH.
The project's goal was to create a database that handles data and applications that handle operations.
This repository includes a contemporary model, a logical model, and basic queries in SQL. Please have a look around and if you have any questions please contact me!

# Short description
The purpose of the project was to create a database for the "Soundgood Music School Company", the database should therefore handle all of the school data. Consisting of students, instruments, teachers, genre, type of lesson, and so on. The project was then split into three smaller assignments - creating a contemporary model, a logical model and finally queries in SQL.

# Contemporary Model
The contemporary model works like a mindmap of the database and was in this assignment created using a software called Astah. The model describes what should be stored in the database and its relationship to others. The conceptual model does not include details of the data or implementations.

# Logical Model
The logical model was also created in Astah and defines entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints more specifically than the conceptual model. The model is also normalized meaning the tables are small to avoid duplications.

# Queries in SQL
The last step of the project was to create the database from the Astah software and, thereafter generate fake database content like names, instruments, or classroom information. Finally, queries were written in SQL consisting of several assignments that are specified in the SQL file.
